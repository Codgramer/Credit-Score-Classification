# Credit Score Classification and Data Analysis Project
Self Project


Developed a comprehensive credit score classification system by implementing data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover data patterns and correlations. Applied PyCaret to build and compare classification models, selecting K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the optimal model and achieving balanced class distribution through SMOTE. Designed a robust data pipeline for imputation, normalization, and model training, ensuring future scalability and reproducibility.
